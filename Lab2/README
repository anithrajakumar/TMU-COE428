Everything worked. As expect we are able to take in no arguments, 1 argument and 
3 argument and we are still about to perform the algorithm 

Q1 > towers(4, 2, 1), we can see from the algorithm that the disk count will decrease by one, 
     and that the spare will be 6 - 3 - 2 giving us the out we expect.

Q2 > we are able to use the formula (2^n)-1 to find the number of empty invocations or we could 
    simply count them, in doing so we obtain 31 recursive calls.

Q3 > The top disk of the tower will be moved from pin 2 to pin 3

Q4 > towers(4, 1, 3), we can see that towers(n-1, spare, dest) gets called and that the values for 
     this are 5-1, 1, 3 giving us the answer we get.

Q5 > if towers(8, 1, 2) were to be called we can use the formula (2^n)-1 to find the number of lines, 
     giving us the value of 255 lines to move one tower from one to pin to another.
