Everything works as expected, sorting the numbers from samllest to biggest.

The mySort function is able to adapt to the new betterSort function, as the parameters can be used from the parameter from the mySort.

void mySort(int d[], unsigned int n)
{
    betterSort(d, 0, n-1);
}   

The array will still be sorted as we expect with the added fuction that we can sort from 0th index to nth index. "n" was previously used for the total number of items and it still can be used like that inorder to function the same as before.
